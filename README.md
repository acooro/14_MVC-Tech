# 14_MVC-Tech

## Description

As a developer, I wanted to create a new CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blogs and comment on other posts. This app will use Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. Lastly, I will deploy the app on https://railway.app/
